        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Jambalaya is a hearty one-pot meal with deep roots in Southern Louisiana. Enslaved Western and Central Africans were thought to be the first to make this dish, using indigenous red rice that was brought to the Americas from colonialized lands. These cooks would use the meats, vegetables, and spices that were available to them to create this delicious dish. 

        While jambalaya can sometimes be similar in flavor to gumbo, it has a different texture and uses different cooking techniques. Gumbo is usually saucy and served spooned over rice, and jambalaya is more like paella, where the rice is cooked in the same pot with broth and other ingredients soaking up most of that liquid. Jambalaya recipes also vary slightly depending on whether they are historically Cajun or Creole in origin. Learn how to make this Cajun jambalaya recipe, plus what sets the two apart.</p>
